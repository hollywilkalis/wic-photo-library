# Oregon WIC Photo Library

#### A custom photo library for the Oregon WIC Program

#### By Holly Wilkalis

## Description

The customer has a new photo library that they would like to make available to their employees, who are located in offices across the state. The photos are used for educational materials, presentations, and other related projects. The goal is to increase the viability of this resource by providing a searchable library to allow their users the ability to search the library based on topic-based keywords (such as breastfeeding or toddler) and download photos for local use.
